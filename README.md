Smart Office Management System (SOMS) is a Node.js web application that is used to manage certain processes required by people in an office environment. The web application interfaces with the Raspberry Pi 3 and various modules connected to it to carry out its functionalities.

SOMS is an application to manage and track employeesâ€™ daily attendance, monitor and control the lights and camera in the office.

For CA2, we will be extending from CA1 to include the functionality to allow users to track the number of people in a particular room. We will be utilising a lightweight communications protocol called Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) to publish and subscribe messages to and from certain topics from the AWS IoT broker.
